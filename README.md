# Scripts
It is a bat file for Windows that is used to install all the dependencies
of React.
# Need
As for the begineers it is very difficult for them to install all the 
dependencies. It has been used by some of my juniors in college.
# Working
Basically it is a sequence of installation procedures to be followed.
It not only downloads the dependencies but it also makes the webpack bundle
files and the required file structure for it.
